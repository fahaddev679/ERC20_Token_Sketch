# ERC20_Token_Sketch
I have created a token on ERC20 standards with all the basic functions that this standard provides.
# Not recommended to copy.
This code is only designed for testing purposes and is not recommended to anyone to copy for real-world projects because Openzeppelin would be a great option for these kinds of tokens.
